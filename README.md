# PasteRevive

A fork of the PasteZort backdoor aimed at python 3.


 
## DISCLAIMER



I am not the author of the backdoor, I just adapted it for python 3. 

I am NOT RESPONSIBLE for what you will do with this backdoor, and I ALSO DO NOT CALL ANYONE TO ANY ACTION.

Everything that you will find here is made an exception for EDUCATIONAL purposes.


## Installation

To start using it, you need to install python 3 and later versions (3.1, 3.2, etc).

After that, you need to clone this repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shizamuru-dev/PasteRevive.git
```

Then you need to change the access rights:

```bash
sudo chmod a+xrw main.py
sudo chmod a+xrw encode.rb
```

And finally clean the folder from garbage:

```bash
sudo rm -f README.md
sudo rm -f LICENSE
```
    

## Usage

Run the script using python:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You will see this menu:

In it, you need to select the system for which you need to create a backdoor. I will choose 1, which is for Windows

Now we have to choose the payload:

I will choose 4.

Next, you need to specify your ip (from must be static) and port:

Fine, it remains only to enter the words or phrases you need. I chose GOTHERE and COPYME :)

Write "y" to automatically launch metasploit

After launching, you will see a message with your IP address to check the backdoor yourself.

It looks something like this:
